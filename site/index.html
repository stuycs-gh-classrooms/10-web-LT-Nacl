    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>From remote controls to car engines, microcontrollers are everywhere. They serve an increasingly critical role in
      every facet of technology and by extension life, and now more than ever, understanding them and their background
      is a useful skill to participate in the fields of technology and science. Some notable buzz-words that are
      associated with microcontrollers are IOT devices, Robotics, Manufacturing, and automation. For a device with such
      a large range of uses, itâ€™s logical to question what they even are in the first place, how to use them, and all
      their relevant use cases. Through this small informational website, I hope to pass this information to you. In
      short, a microcontroller is an integrated circuit designed to carry out operations. A microcontroller is
      accompanied by programmable memory and methods of inputting and outputting signals, as well as everything it needs
      to function on its own. Often thought of as small computers, these devices allow you to execute simple and
      specialized programs and, making them useful for interfacing directly with other electronic components, hence
      their involvement in automation and heavy industry. Their (typically) small form factor and cheap price of
      manufacturing also makes them the logical option for products that only need limited computational power-for
      example, your keyboard is likely using its own microcontroller to process the inputs from the keys and turn them
      into something your computer can use. Microcontrollers typically look not too much different from your average IC
      (integrated circuit), although they will most commonly be seen in the form of a development board, which serves to
      provide additional functionality for ease of development and testing on these microcontrollers. Pictured to the
      right is a render of the Arduino Uno, one of the most ubiquitous microcontroller development boards facilitating
      the use of an ATmega328P microproccesor. Click around the tabs shown at the top to learn more.</t>
