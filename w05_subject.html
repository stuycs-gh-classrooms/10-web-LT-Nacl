	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p>Object Oriented Programming is a programming model built around the concepts of objects and classes.<br>
	These objects serve to follow these four principles: </p>

	<h2>ENCAPSULATION</h2>
	<p>A class serves as a way to make objects to hold, or incapsulate, methods or variables in a
	single place.<br>An class contains all information and methods relevant to itself, as well as
	the instructions for instantiating an object to use/hold this stuff. </p>

        <h2>ABSTRACTION</h2>
	<p>When using objects, you may want some details to only be accessible from within an object. Thankfully,
	through abstraction, you can specifify whether or not implimentations are accesible from the outside.</p> 

        <h2>INHERITANCE</h2>
	<p>When coding in OOP, you may want charachteristics of a class to be reused with modifications in subsequent
	sub-class. Through inheritance, a class may impliment features of a parent super-class and make any neccesary
	modifications. For example, a super class of "animal" could have sublasses of "dog" and "cat", which maintain
	core methods like "eat" and "breath" yet also have their own unique methods like "bark" and "meow" </p>

        <h2>POLYMORPHISM</h2>
	<p>Continuing with our dog/cat example from last segment, there may be a time where we make a new blank animal object and not a cat or dog.
	Thankfully, thankfully through polymorphism (coming from poly, many, and morpism, changing) we can change our blank animal into a cat or dog. </p>
